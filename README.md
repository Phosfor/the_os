TheOS
=====

TheOS (read "The OS" or "Theos", greak for god) is a toy OS/kernel written in Rust.
Currently only the RISC-V architecture is supported.
The design is based on micro-kernel principles, i.e. only keep in the kernel, what cannot (efficiently) be implemented in user-space.


This is an seld-educational project. That is, it is not necessarily intendet to be fast or efficient for everyday use.
I started this project to learn more about OS/kernel-development and the RISC-V architecture (and extend my Rust-skills).
